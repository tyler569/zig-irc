## Zig IRC

A small IRC client program in the programming language [zig](https://ziglang.org/).

#### Building:

`zig build-exe irc.zig`

#### Running:

`./irc`

For the moment, it's hardcoded to an IRC server and channel in code, I'll keep poking at this and hopefully make it better in the future.

This is also a fairly straight translation of a C IRC client I had lying around, so please don't take this as an example of idiomatic zig!
